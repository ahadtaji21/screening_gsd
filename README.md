# Purpose

As part of Islamic Relief Worldwide’s (IRW) commitment to safer recruitment, the Pre-Employment Compliance Checklist (PCC) is designed to verify the various preconditions of the role a prospective employee is applying for. The PCC identifies the key checks that need to be undertaken following the selection of the candidate but in advance of a contract of employment being signed. This includes their right-to-work, criminal record checks, confirmation of professional registration and qualifications, their references, and online and social media due diligence.

IRW operates to a high ethical and moral standard underpinned by its values. The PCC safeguards IRW’s standards, values and safeguarding obligations; it also protects the welfare of colleagues and the stakeholders we serve both in the United Kingdom and abroad. 

# Responsibility

The responsibility to undertake the pre-employment due diligence sits with the Human Resources (HR) departments at IRW and the Field Offices (FO). International HR will be responsible for ensuring that the Field Offices comply with the PCC and implement appropriate practices, processes, controls and training to ensure compliance. 

In instances where there are time delays, information is lacking, gaps exist or adverse information is found, HR should report to the departmental HR manager for advice. The HR manager, however, must seek direction from IRW’s the Head of Governance in complex cases or where legal decisions need to be considered. In all circumstances, the decision and reasons for confirming or refusing employment must be recorded. 

# Confidentiality

The PCC collects Sensitive Personal Data and therefore must be kept confidential and only available to those within HR who legitimately need access.   

Moreover, the series of checks on prospective employees, from obtaining an original right-to-work documents to undertaking a Disclosure and Barring Service, must adhere to IRW’s Data Protection Policy. This relates to how personal data is obtained, used, stored and otherwise processed.  The information obtained must be accurately reflected in the PCC form and upon employment migrated to the newly hired employee’s cascade account under the compliance heading for reporting purposes. 

Upon hire, the PCC form should be stored and secured in the employee’s personnel file.
